# Getting started

This is a simple example to help you quickly start MagCluster journey. We use the genome of ***Candidatus* Magnetominusculus xianensis strain HCH-1** to show how it works. Candidatus Magnetominusculus xianensis strain HCH-1 is a metagenomic assembled genome ([see the paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/9/2171#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20origin%20of%20magnetotactic%20behavior%20remains%20a,the%20earliest%20magnetic-sensing%20and%20biomineralizing%20organisms%20on%20Earth.)) which we will refer to as HCH-1 in this tutorial. 

## Step 1: Obtaining data
You can download HCH-1 from NCBI ([LNQR00000000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/LNQR01?display=contigs&page=1)) or from [example]() in this project.
